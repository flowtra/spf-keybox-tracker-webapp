# SPF OB Key Locker Webapp

Built as a trainee in the Singapore Police Force, this Flask-based webapp utilises JS/HTML/CSS/Jinjja to display buttons that represent whether keys have been drawn from the electronic key locker. This replaces the manual counting and typing of a key status summary every night for over 500 keys.
